Don't try to implement everything at once. Pick 2-3 Sunnats and make them consistent, then gradually add more!

:::note Remember
Every Sunnah you revive earns you immense reward. The Prophet ﷺ said: "Whoever revives a Sunnah from my Sunnah and the people practice it, he will have the same reward of those who practice it without their rewards being diminished." (Sunan Ibn Majah)

May Allah help us follow the beautiful example of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. Ameen!
