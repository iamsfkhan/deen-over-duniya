# Hadiths from Sahih Muslim

<div className="bismillah">بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ</div>

Sahih Muslim is another highly authentic collection of Hadith, compiled by Imam Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj. Together with Sahih Bukhari, these two collections are known as the "Sahihain" (The Two Sahihs).

## 1. The Definition of a Muslim

<div className="hadith-box">
  <div className="hadith-arabic">
    عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ: قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم: «الْمُسْلِمُ مَنْ سَلِمَ الْمُسْلِمُونَ مِنْ لِسَانِهِ وَيَدِهِ، وَالْمُؤْمِنُ مَنْ أَمِنَهُ النَّاسُ عَلَى دِمَائِهِمْ وَأَمْوَالِهِمْ»
  </div>
  <div className="hadith-translation">
    On the authority of Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him), the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: "The Muslim is the one from whose tongue and hand the Muslims are safe, and the believer is the one from whom the people are secure with regard to their lives and wealth."
  </div>
  <div className="hadith-reference">
    Sahih Muslim, Book 1, Hadith 64
  </div>
</div>

### Lessons from this Hadith:
- **Character matters**: A true Muslim doesn't harm others
- **Trustworthiness**: People should feel safe around believers
- **Control your tongue**: What we say matters as much as what we do

<div className="hadith-box">
  <div className="hadith-arabic">
    عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ: قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم: «مَنْ دَعَا إِلَى هُدًى كَانَ لَهُ مِنَ الأَجْرِ مِثْلُ أُجُورِ مَنْ تَبِعَهُ لاَ يَنْقُصُ ذَلِكَ مِنْ أُجُورِهِمْ شَيْئًا»
  </div>
  <div className="hadith-translation">
    Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: "He who calls (people) to guidance will have a reward like the rewards of those who follow him, without their rewards being diminished in any respect on that account."
  </div>
  <div className="hadith-reference">
    Sahih Muslim, Book 34, Hadith 6470
