## Introduction

**Umar ibn Al-Khattab** (may Allah be pleased with him), known as **Al-Farooq** (The one who distinguishes between truth and falsehood), was the second Caliph of Islam. His strength, justice, and fear of Allah made him one of the greatest leaders in Islamic history.

## Before Islam: A Fierce Opponent

Before accepting Islam, Umar (RA) was one of the fiercest enemies of Muslims. He was:
- Strong and fearless
- Influential in Quraysh
- So opposed to Islam that he set out to kill the Prophet ﷺ

But Allah had different plans for him...

---

## The Miraculous Conversion

On his way to kill the Prophet ﷺ, Umar learned that his own sister and brother-in-law had accepted Islam. He went to their house in rage, but what happened next changed everything.

<div className="hadith-box">
  <div className="hadith-translation">
    When Umar entered his sister's house, they were reciting Surah Ta-Ha. After striking his sister in anger and seeing her bleed, his heart softened. He asked to read what they were reciting. After reading the verses, he said: "How beautiful and noble is this speech!" He then went directly to the Prophet ﷺ and accepted Islam.

### The Prayer Was Answered

The Prophet ﷺ had made a special dua:

<div className="hadith-box">
  <div className="hadith-arabic">
    اللَّهُمَّ أَعِزَّ الإِسْلاَمَ بِأَحَبِّ هَذَيْنِ الرَّجُلَيْنِ إِلَيْكَ: بِأَبِي جَهْلٍ أَوْ بِعُمَرَ بْنِ الْخَطَّابِ
  </div>
  <div className="hadith-translation">
    "O Allah, strengthen Islam through one of these two men whom You love more: Abu Jahl or Umar ibn Al-Khattab."
  </div>
  <div className="hadith-reference">
    Sunan al-Tirmidhi
  </div>
</div>

Allah chose Umar!

## Islam Became Public

When Umar accepted Islam, everything changed:

- Muslims could now pray openly at the Kaaba
- Islam gained strength and visibility
- The Quraysh became more fearful
- The Prophet ﷺ said: "Allah has placed truth upon Umar's tongue and heart"

<div className="hadith-box">
  <div className="hadith-translation">
    Abdullah ibn Mas'ud (RA) said: "Umar's Islam was a victory, his migration was a triumph, and his caliphate was a mercy. We could not pray at the Kaaba until Umar accepted Islam."
  </div>
  <div className="hadith-reference">
    Musnad Ahmad
  </div>
</div>

## His Fear of Allah

Despite his strength and authority, Umar (RA) had immense fear of Allah:

<div className="hadith-box">
  <div className="hadith-translation">
    Umar (RA) had two black lines on his face from constant weeping out of fear of Allah.
  </div>
  <div className="hadith-reference">
    Hilyat al-Awliya
  </div>
</div>

Once he read the verse:
<div className="hadith-box">
  <div className="hadith-arabic">
    وَإِذَا الْكِتَابُ نُشِرَ
  </div>
  <div className="hadith-translation">
    "And when the records are spread open..." (Quran 81:10)
  </div>
</div>

He was sick for a month from fear of his record being opened on the Day of Judgment!

---

## His Justice

Umar's justice is legendary. Here are some examples:

### Example 1: A Governor's Son
When the son of Amr ibn al-As (a governor) struck an Egyptian, Umar made the Egyptian strike him back and said his famous words:
<div className="hadith-box">
  <div className="hadith-translation">
    "Since when have you enslaved people when their mothers gave birth to them free?"
  </div>
</div>

### Example 2: Equal Treatment
Umar stood in line for his share of food like everyone else. When someone tried to give him preference, he refused.

### Example 3: Personal Accountability
He would go out at night to check on his people's needs, carrying food on his own back for widows and orphans.

## Expansion of Islam

During Umar's caliphate (10 years), Islam expanded tremendously:
- Persia fell
- Byzantine Empire lost Syria, Palestine, and Egypt
- Jerusalem was conquered peacefully
- Islamic state grew to unprecedented size

But with all this power, he remained humble!

---

## His Humility

Despite ruling the largest empire of his time:

- He wore patched clothes
- He slept on a mat that left marks on his side
- He ate simple food
- He worked for widows and orphans personally

<div className="hadith-box">
  <div className="hadith-translation">
    When foreign ambassadors came to meet the Caliph, they found Umar sleeping under a tree without guards. They said: "You ruled with justice, so you slept in peace."
  </div>
</div>

## The Quran Agrees with Umar

Multiple times, Quranic revelations agreed with Umar's opinions:

1. **Making Maqam Ibrahim a place of prayer** (Quran 2:125)
2. **Hijab for the Prophet's wives** (Quran 33:53)
3. **Prohibition of prayer for hypocrites after death** (Quran 9:84)
4. **Consultation about prisoners of Badr** (Quran 8:67)

<div className="hadith-box">
  <div className="hadith-translation">
    The Prophet ﷺ said: "Allah has placed truth upon Umar's tongue and heart."
  </div>
  <div className="hadith-reference">

  </div>
</div>

## Shaytan Fears Umar

<div className="hadith-box">
  <div className="hadith-arabic">
    قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم: «إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ لَيَخَافُ مِنْكَ يَا عُمَرُ»
  </div>
  <div className="hadith-translation">
    The Prophet ﷺ said: "Indeed, Shaytan is afraid of you, O Umar!"
  </div>
  <div className="hadith-reference">
    Sunan al-Tirmidhi
  </div>
</div>

## His Martyrdom

Umar (RA) was martyred while leading Fajr prayer by Abu Lu'lu'ah, a Persian slave, in 644 CE. Even in his final moments:

- He insisted the prayer continue
- He worried about the state of the Muslims
- He asked to be buried next to the Prophet ﷺ and Abu Bakr (RA)

His last advice:
<div className="hadith-box">
  <div className="hadith-translation">
    "I advise the Caliph after me to fear Allah, to be kind to the early migrants, to recognize their rights and protect their honor, and to be kind to the Ansar..."
  </div>
</div>

## Lessons from Umar's Life

1. **It's Never Too Late**: From enemy to champion of Islam
2. **Justice for All**: Treat everyone equally, regardless of status
3. **Fear Allah**: No matter how powerful you are
4. **Stay Humble**: Success shouldn't change your character
5. **Serve the People**: Leadership is responsibility, not privilege
6. **Seek Truth**: Be willing to change when you find it

:::tip Reflect
Umar (RA) transformed completely when he encountered truth. Are you willing to change for the better when you learn something new?
:::

May Allah be pleased with Umar Al-Farooq and allow us to follow his example of justice, humility, and strength. Ameen.
