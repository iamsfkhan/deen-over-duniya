  <div className="hadith-arabic">
    عَنِ ابْنِ عُمَرَ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمَا قَالَ: قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم: «بُنِيَ الإِسْلاَمُ عَلَى خَمْسٍ: شَهَادَةِ أَنْ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ، وَإِقَامِ الصَّلاَةِ، وَإِيتَاءِ الزَّكَاةِ، وَالْحَجِّ، وَصَوْمِ رَمَضَانَ»
  </div>
  <div className="hadith-translation">
    Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: "Islam is built upon five: testifying that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, establishing prayer, paying Zakah, making pilgrimage to the House, and fasting the month of Ramadan."
